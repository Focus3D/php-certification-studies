**Here are my tips:**

1) Download http://ankisrs.net/ and study some PHP Flashcards. They have one only for php certification.

2) I bought the study guide from Zend (It was around $30). I printed it and studied every page.

3) I tried to solve some questions from a Brazilian PHP Certification Group:  (http://rumoacertificacaophp.com). Most of the questions are in English, so.. it really helps!!

4) I was saving here in this repository some examples. I'm still using it as reference when I don't remember some php syntax or function usage.

**Good luck!**
